### Vision
Azure Cognitive Services for Vision is a cloud based service that offers innovative computer vision capabilities. You can analyze images, read text, and detect faces with prebuilt image tagging, conduct text extraction with optical character recognition (OCR), and perform responsible facial recognition. These vision features can be integrated into your projects with no machine learning experience required.

* [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)
  
### Speech 
Azure Cognitive Services for Speech provides speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities. You can transcribe speech to text with high accuracy, produce natural-sounding text-to-speech voices, translate spoken audio, and use speaker recognition during conversations. In addition, you can create custom voices, add specific words to your base vocabulary, or build your own models. The service can be run in the cloud or at the edge in containers.

### Language 
Azure Language is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. With Azure Cognitive services, you use pre-made models to identify entities, summarize text , find key phrases, understand sentiment, and more. There are more custom routes that allow you to create models that are able to extract key information and classify text for more specific use cases, create Q&A chatbots,  and orchestrate  workflows to connect language models to other services.
