## **Generative Answers/Boost Conversations** 
Power Virtual Agents generative answers capabilities (Also known as conversation boosters) expands to include multiple knowledge sources – external sites, documents, internal Sharepoint sites, or a combination of these – and instantly have rich, multi-turn conversations over that knowledge, available in Public Preview. This also includes a new generative answers node which allows more granular use of generative answers by topic, vs all up fallback. If you have an Azure OpenAI Service instance for your company data, you can hook it up for PVA to use with a few clicks, allowing your bots full access to those capabilities. Invite customers to try out generative answers now with a simple demo bot (aka.ms/pvademo) - just add in your company website and start chatting.

## **Generative Actions** 
Using the generative actions capability, Power Virtual Agents can automate bot responses with action. Rather than manually building every action for the bot, bot makers can expose their tools to the bot (like tenant APIs, enterprise specific Power Automate Flows or more), which PVA can automatically chain together to produce responses and even ask users for additional information. With the generative actions tracing canvas, builders can monitor the bot's process and question generation.
