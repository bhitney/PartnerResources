Microsoft Viva Sales is a seller experience, an application, which leverages Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams to automatically capture, access, and register data into any customer relationship management (CRM) system.

**Configure Viva Sales** in your Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement demo environment to highlight how sellers can become more productive within their customer relationship management (CRM) application. 

These two videos provide presales engineers guidance on how to **configure** and **demonstrate** the integrated experience between Viva Sales, Dynamics 365 Sales, Teams, and Outlook.
