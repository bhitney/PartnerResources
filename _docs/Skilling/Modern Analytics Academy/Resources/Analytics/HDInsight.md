# Azure HDInsight Readiness Resources

Azure HDInsight is a managed analytics service. With HDInsight, you can use open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Kafka, and Hadoop. HDInsight can be configured with different cluster types based on an enterprise's analytical needs (streaming, analytics, warehousing, etc.); this includes a basic Hadoop cluster, Spark cluster, HBase cluster, and so on.
